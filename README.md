# low_risk_investor
code for testing out the investment algorithm from the book `Low Risk Investing`.

- used `scrapy` to pull the tickers for the stock names found on the Toronto exchange.
- used `requests` and `beautifulsoup` in pulling the count of advanced and declined stocks.
- used `plotly` for graphing in the twa_test file.
- testing of `asyncio` and `threading` to run a function that makes an http call to scrape the data and is looped over a large list of stocks.
